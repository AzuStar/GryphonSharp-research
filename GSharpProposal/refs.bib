  abstract   = {A truly general purpose programming language, GPL, is described which contains facilities for constructing (within the language) new data types as well as facilities for operations performed upon them. The basic language is minimal in the sense that no basic element can be derived from the others with high efficiency in the object programs. Constructs like the ALGOL 60 for-statements, and if-statements are not basic; they are special types of procedures. New “symbols” (underlined words in ALGOL 60) are implicitly defined by usage in other declarations. As part words are definable, packed words are handled as easily as full words. “Address” variables (pointers) are included in full generality.},

abstract = {Deep learning is one of the fastest growing technologies in computer science with a plethora of applications. But this unprecedented growth has so far been limited to the consumption of deep learning experts. The primary challenge being a steep learning curve for learning the programming libraries and the lack of intuitive systems enabling non-experts to consume deep learning. Towards this goal, we study the effectiveness of a "no-code" paradigm for designing deep learning models. Particularly, a visual drag-and-drop interface is found more efficient when compared with the traditional programming and alternative visual programming paradigms. We conduct user studies of different expertise levels to measure the entry level barrier and the developer load across different programming paradigms. We obtain a System Usability Scale (SUS) of 90 and a NASA Task Load index (TLX) score of 21 for the proposed visual programming compared to 68 and 52, respectively, for the traditional programming methods.},
